# Sai-Nandan-Sambu
Hello! I'm Sainandan Sambu, an aspiring Data Analyst with a Master's in Applied Statistics from Osmania University. With a background in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, I have honed my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. My passion lies in uncovering insights from data to drive decision-making and problem-solving.

I have hands-on experience with tools like Python, MS Excel, SQL, and Power BI, which I've utilized in various projects. These include creating a dynamic Excel dashboard for stock price comparison, designing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for a transportation service, and predicting car prices using machine learning algorithms. Currently, I'm working on classifying disaster tweets, aiming to enhance real-time information delivery to disaster response teams.

Beyond technical skills, I bring strong analytical thinking, effective communication abilities, and a collaborative mindset. I'm eager to apply my knowledge and skills in an entry-level data analyst position to contribute to impactful projects and continue learning in a professional environment.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out to me at nandansambu511@gmail.com. Let's connect and discuss how we can leverage data to solve real-world challenges!
