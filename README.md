# Sai-Nandan-Sambu
Hello! I'm Sainandan Sambu, an aspiring Data Analyst with a Master's in Applied Statistics from Osmania University. With a background in Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, I have honed my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. My passion lies in uncovering insights from data to drive decision-making and problem-solving.

I have hands-on experience with tools like Python, MS Excel, SQL, and Power BI, which I've utilized in various projects. These include creating a dynamic Excel dashboard for stock price comparison, designing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for a transportation service, and predicting car prices using machine learning algorithms. Currently, I'm working on classifying disaster tweets, aiming to enhance real-time information delivery to disaster response teams.

Beyond technical skills, I bring strong analytical thinking, effective communication abilities, and a collaborative mindset. I'm eager to apply my knowledge and skills in an entry-level data analyst position to contribute to impactful projects and continue learning in a professional environment.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out to me at nandansambu511@gmail.com. Let's connect and discuss how we can leverage data to solve real-world challenges!

## Portfolio Projects

### Python

#### Car Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

Analyzed and visualized a large dataset of resale car prices. Implemented and evaluated Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting models for price prediction. Achieved the highest accuracy of 92% with Gradient Boosting. Validated model performance through comparison of predicted and actual prices, identifying critical factors influencing car prices.

#### Disaster Tweets Classification
Currently working on identifying tweets about real disasters. Implementing machine learning methods such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, KNN, and BERT. Evaluating and comparing the performance of these models to accurately distinguish real disaster tweets from those using similar keywords metaphorically. This project aims to enhance real-time information delivery to disaster response teams.

### SQL

#### Namma Yatri Transportation Service Analysis
Utilized SQL to explore and analyze data for Namma Yatri, a transportation service in Hyderabad. This involved deep data exploration, identifying key metrics, and deriving insights from the dataset. The insights gathered from SQL analysis were then visualized using Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that includes number cards, line charts, interactive tables, and a map with bubble sizes representing search volumes.

### Excel / Google Sheets

#### Stock Price Comparison Excel Dashboard
Developed a dynamic Excel dashboard to compare stock prices of Apple, Google, and Microsoft. Utilized advanced functions like INDEX and MATCH for detailed data analysis. Integrated dropdown lists to select columns such as Closing price, Opening price, High price, Low price, Adjusted close price, and Volume. Created individual price charts for each company and designed a comprehensive chart comparing stock prices of all three companies.
